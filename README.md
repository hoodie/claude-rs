# Claude

A money library.

This is a very simple little library to represent money. It is essentially an opinionated fork of [currency v0.3.0](https://crates.io/crates/currency).

This may in the future be replaced by other versions of currency or [steel-cent](https://crates.io/crates/steel-cent).

## Why 'Claude'?

It's a play on words/a name. See [Claude Mone~~y~~t](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet).
